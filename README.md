# Frontend Mentor Challenges

On my efforts on improving my frontend skills, here are my solutions for some of the challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## Repository Structure

Each challenge has its own folder, named after the challenge's name. Inside each folder, there are the following files:
- `README.md`: This file contains the challenge's description, the design preview, and the instructions to build the project.
- `design`: This folder contains the design files for the challenge. The design files are in JPG static format.
- `assets`: This folder contains all the required assets for the challenge.
- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure for the challenge.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the challenge.
